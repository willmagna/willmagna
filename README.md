### About

I’m a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer with a background in Computer Engineering (2017) and hands-on experience building, scaling, and operating production-grade SaaS and AI-driven systems.

I work end-to-end: from system design and architecture to implementation, deployment, and production ownership. My focus is on building reliable, scalable products that generate real business value and revenue, especially in B2B environments.

Over the years, I’ve acted as developer, founding engineer, CTO, and technical consultant, delivering complex platforms involving payments, distributed systems, background processing, AI agents, and WhatsApp-based operational systems used by real customers at scale.

I’m driven by genuine technical curiosity and execution focus — solving problems, delivering results, and operating efficiently even under high pressure and ambiguity.
